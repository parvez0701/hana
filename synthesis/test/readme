Architecture of the regression suite:

	Objectives:
		1. Suite should be flexible. We should be able to run
			any subset of regression testcases.
		2. Suite should be customizable. We should be able to add
		3. testcases with varying options passed to the tool.

	Details:
		1. Suite based on Makefile and Perl.
		2. There will be one perl script which runs the tool and
			and does diff with golden output.
		3. Tree like structure of the suite.
		4. Every directory to have a Makefile. All but leaf level
			Makefiles will simply call make in sub-directories.
		5. Leaf level Makefile will actually call the perl script.
		6. Every leaf level directory will have a file named 
			.references. This file will contain name of the output files
			against the golden ones. Also this file will contain tool
			command options.
			Example:
				EXE=bulah
				OPTIONS= test.v -d test_dec.v
				FILES=test_gold.v test_dec.v
		7. To run regression from any lower directory, you need to set
			enviorenment variable REGSCRIPT to point to regression.pl
			script.
		8. Add exe path in your search path.
		9. Restrictions mentioned 7 & 8 to be removed.
		10. Testcases can be update using make update command. This
			however does not check them in into the CVS. This option
			is provided only in the leaf level Makefiles.
